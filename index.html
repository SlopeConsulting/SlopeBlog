Spring Break is upon us and I took the opportunity to travel a bit before hunkering down today in Swem to get some work done.
Little did I know when I made these plans that Spring Break would be extended by quite a bit. Regardless, I did end up making
it in to the library this morning for a few hours. Because I had to miss the toolbox lecture due to work I decided today to attempt to
work on that aspect of the project. As such, I read the blog entry and downloaded the toolbox to begin looking it over. If I'm being
honest I don't understand quite a bit of it and I'm very frustrated that the toolbox session for this Sunday had to be cancelled.
That being said I did end up running your toolbox with the data I had.

Looking forward I think most of tomorrow and this weekend will be spent making sure I've hit these learning goals. Initally I was going to spend
time working on a presentation for Monday's session but it seems like that isn't happening anymore so I'm going to focus more on my own learing
rather than a consultant presentation.

Today I went over the Colorado Case study and tried to follow along using my own data from California. This went swimmingly until I realised that my MUSYM keys
were completely different from the Colorado data set. I spent a very long time trying to fix this problem and looking up what these codes (instead of numbers)
could mean, but ultimately I decided that switching gears once again and getting some sort of progress was more important than using my own data. So, from now forward
I decided to use the Colorado data to simplify my life.

I followed along the brute force method to create C, Degrees, and Yr values for the Colorado table. Initially I wanted to use my very own code in an if/else statement
to select the needed fields, but the interface for arc pro really confused me. I spent some time looking up basic coding principles/watching tutorials on how these statements worked
and I really thought that I had a good idea of what to do, but every time I ran the code in Arc Pro it kicked back errors. It seemed simple enough to me but I guess I was wrong. I'm
glad I tried it however as I did learn some about the coding process.

In other news I began reading the literature on other models unrelated to the Critical Rainfall Threshold. I doubt I will be able to incorporate or run this model, but
getting an idea for a model different than the one we are currently using might prove useful (and it happens to be a learning requirement).

        Today we switched gears. A new project road map was given to us and we began attempting
a basemap for the capital of Jordan, Ammam. I spent a few hours of looking up utilities data, road data,
and building data to create the basemap and researching a recent landslide that destroyed a highway
connecting the capital to another large city in the country. All of this went well, but due to the
difficulty of finding data and the time constraints on this project, I've decided to switch gears and
persue the same project in the United States first. This test run of the model will focus on southern
California along the senic State Route 1. I chose this area for a few reasons. Most importantly the
amount of data available for southern California is leaps and bounds more than Jordan, Bahrain, or
French Polynesia. Second, the highway is a historic and beloved route connecting up almost the entire
coast of California. Finally, this route has seen its fair shair of landslide events recently and in
the past. The road itself is often closed and requires multi million dollar renovations and hours long
detours for the small towns along its path every time a landslide occurs. Because of this, it is a
perfect testing ground for the economic impact of landslides and our model as a whole.
           </p>
        <p> In other news I began formulating an ethical discussion focusing on where we as
consultants get our data. The book "Weaponizing Maps Indigenous Peoples and Counterinsurgency in the
Americas" discusses the ethical implications of mapping indigenous groups using colonial and
counterinsurgency techniques. The particular story I read and created a discussion about involves a
few indigenous communities in the Sierra Juárez range in Mexico. These communities were exploited by
the Foreign Military Studies Office of the United States Army in the early 2000's, in order to test
counterinsurgency techniques. This story brings up questions concerning where we get our data, and
who funds the process of collecting data. Next week I will be discussing this. </p>

						<p>	Fs is the factor of safety </p>
						<p>	φ is internal angle of friction (deg) </p>
						<p>	θ is hillslope (deg) </p>

Today we went over this formula and began gathering data to impliment our geospatial solutions.
We're excited to begin working for you!
