		Review:
		The direct impact of landslides on household income in tropical regions: A case study from the Rwenzori Mountains in Uganda

		https://search-proquest-com.proxy.wm.edu/docview/1769623954/2F54E874A8144397PQ/1?accountid=15053

		Key Concepts
		-	Cross sectional household survey and GIS data was used to obtain information on the economic status of household sin the Rwenzori Mountains
		-	Income of affected households is significantly reduced in the wake of landslide events for several years
		-	Self-employment or wage employment significantly increases for these individuals, but these activities are usually not enough to compensate for the loss of agricultural revenue
		-	These landslides are localized and thus in this region there are not risk sharing measures in place to lessen the impact

		How GIS Was Used
		-	GPS data at the household level was collected along with the questionnaire to tie economic status and activities with a spatial location
		-	Landslide susceptibility was proxied with Geographical data including slope steepness, lithology (rock type) and, water flow
		-	A DEM and lithology data were used in conjunction with ArcGIS’s Flow Accumulation tool to calculate a relative flow value
		-	This GIS data was plugged into an equation as “susceptibility” to measure an approximation of household welfare
		-	Map layouts were created to overview the study areas

			Here is another paper concerning economic impacts of landslides. Specifically, it estimates the impact on household
			income and mitigation strategies for this region. The study found that 85% of these relatively poor household’s income
			is derived from agriculture and about 40% of them have been directly impacted by landslides in the past 15 years.
			Interestingly there was no significant difference in income levels of affected and unaffected households (over 15 years).
			This was not the case for more recent landslides. In the year following a landslide significant economic impact was felt
			and homeowners turned to other sources of income to supplement agricultural income loss.

			Lower income individuals with smaller plots of land are more at risk for landslides. This was found by analyzing these
			individuals against those with larger plots of land. The authors found that larger land plots increased resistance to
			negative economic impact. In addition, it seems that there were no formal measures  put in place to help those affected
			by these landslides at any point in time over the past 15 years.

			The authors conclude by recommending two mitigation strategies. First, they advise for more attractive stable jobs outside
			agriculture should be pressed into the region. As of now those affected by landslides only temporarily transition to these
			kinds of jobs indicating that they are less preferable to agriculture. Second, they recommend the development of local
			disaster relief funds as no such savings funds exist at this level. These funds can be used to lessen the economic impact
			on the members of the community most affected by landslides.

		Review:
		Direct impacts of landslides on socio-economic systems: a case study from Aranayake, Sri Lanka

		https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40677-018-0104-6



		Key Concepts
		-	Landslides have huge socioeconomic impacts that are oftentimes difficult to quantify.
		-	This study uses a case from Sri Lanka to provide a framework for studying these impacts
		-	Questionnaire from residents to determine economic impacts at a household level
		-	Satellite Imagery was used to find affected land and homes
		-	A regression model was used to estimate the economic value of the affected gardens

		How GIS Was Used
		-	Satellite imagery was used to determine land use and affected homes
		-	Satellite imagery was also used to demarcate the extent of the landslide boundaries
		-	It was also used to make map layouts denoting land use
		-	Field studies using GPS were also used to map affected households and the landslide boundary
			as a ground truth for Google Earth images
		-	The socioeconomic data gathered from questionnaires was incorporated into this GIS data

			This work attempted to quantify the socioeconomic impacts of a particular landslide in the Aranayke
			region of Sri Lanka. A landslide occurred there in May of 2016 resulting in the deaths of 127 individuals
			and significant damage to two villages. The region is heavily dependent on Kandyan home gardens (or KHGs).
			They make up 52% of economic household income and many of the gardens in the area were damaged or
			completely destroyed. Because these gardens are located almost entirely on slopes in the country, they
			represent a significant source of further socioeconomic risk.

			Ultimately the study concluded that the region was producing up to $160,000 in GDP through the use of these
			gardens before the landslide. All of the gardens were affected by this landslide in major or minor ways.
			In addition, the study found that almost all of the gardens in this region were threatened by future landslides.
			Approximately $40,000 of damage was done to the region in this one event.

			This study serves as a fantastic case for further analysis of the economic impact of landslides in this region
			and other regions. By using a combination of field surveys and remote sensing data/satellite imagery the authors
			produced a compelling quantifiable estimate of damages. It’s not unreasonable to apply this approach to other areas
			at risk for or already affected by landslide disasters. Studies like this can help convince local officials that
			landslide preparation is in the best interest of the community both morally and economically.

Spring Break is upon us and I took the opportunity to travel a bit before hunkering down today in Swem to get some work done.
Little did I know when I made these plans that Spring Break would be extended by quite a bit. Regardless, I did end up making
it in to the library this morning for a few hours. Because I had to miss the toolbox lecture due to work I decided today to attempt to
work on that aspect of the project. As such, I read the blog entry and downloaded the toolbox to begin looking it over. If I'm being
honest I don't understand quite a bit of it and I'm very frustrated that the toolbox session for this Sunday had to be cancelled.
That being said I did end up running your toolbox with the data I had.

Looking forward I think most of tomorrow and this weekend will be spent making sure I've hit these learning goals. Initally I was going to spend
time working on a presentation for Monday's session but it seems like that isn't happening anymore so I'm going to focus more on my own learing
rather than a consultant presentation.

Today I went over the Colorado Case study and tried to follow along using my own data from California. This went swimmingly until I realised that my MUSYM keys
were completely different from the Colorado data set. I spent a very long time trying to fix this problem and looking up what these codes (instead of numbers)
could mean, but ultimately I decided that switching gears once again and getting some sort of progress was more important than using my own data. So, from now forward
I decided to use the Colorado data to simplify my life.

I followed along the brute force method to create C, Degrees, and Yr values for the Colorado table. Initially I wanted to use my very own code in an if/else statement
to select the needed fields, but the interface for arc pro really confused me. I spent some time looking up basic coding principles/watching tutorials on how these statements worked
and I really thought that I had a good idea of what to do, but every time I ran the code in Arc Pro it kicked back errors. It seemed simple enough to me but I guess I was wrong. I'm
glad I tried it however as I did learn some about the coding process.

In other news I began reading the literature on other models unrelated to the Critical Rainfall Threshold. I doubt I will be able to incorporate or run this model, but
getting an idea for a model different than the one we are currently using might prove useful (and it happens to be a learning requirement).

        Today we switched gears. A new project road map was given to us and we began attempting
a basemap for the capital of Jordan, Ammam. I spent a few hours of looking up utilities data, road data,
and building data to create the basemap and researching a recent landslide that destroyed a highway
connecting the capital to another large city in the country. All of this went well, but due to the
difficulty of finding data and the time constraints on this project, I've decided to switch gears and
persue the same project in the United States first. This test run of the model will focus on southern
California along the senic State Route 1. I chose this area for a few reasons. Most importantly the
amount of data available for southern California is leaps and bounds more than Jordan, Bahrain, or
French Polynesia. Second, the highway is a historic and beloved route connecting up almost the entire
coast of California. Finally, this route has seen its fair shair of landslide events recently and in
the past. The road itself is often closed and requires multi million dollar renovations and hours long
detours for the small towns along its path every time a landslide occurs. Because of this, it is a
perfect testing ground for the economic impact of landslides and our model as a whole.
           </p>
        <p> In other news I began formulating an ethical discussion focusing on where we as
consultants get our data. The book "Weaponizing Maps Indigenous Peoples and Counterinsurgency in the
Americas" discusses the ethical implications of mapping indigenous groups using colonial and
counterinsurgency techniques. The particular story I read and created a discussion about involves a
few indigenous communities in the Sierra Juárez range in Mexico. These communities were exploited by
the Foreign Military Studies Office of the United States Army in the early 2000's, in order to test
counterinsurgency techniques. This story brings up questions concerning where we get our data, and
who funds the process of collecting data. Next week I will be discussing this. </p>
